## Graph-Based Memory

  alt="Knowledge Graph"

GAIA builds a living knowledge graph that connects all aspects of your work.

### How It Works

The knowledge graph creates relationships between:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task: Q1 Report] --> B[Meeting: Strategy Review]
    A --> C[Email: CFO Request]
    A --> D[Document: Financial Data]
    B --> E[Person: Sarah from Finance]
    B --> F[Goal: Revenue Growth]
    C --> E
    D --> F
```

<Note>
  **Everything connects:** Tasks link to projects, meetings link to documents, emails link to people and goals. GAIA understands the full context of your work.
</Note>
