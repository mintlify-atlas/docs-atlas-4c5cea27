## The Problem GAIA Solves

We all drown in tools. Gmail, Calendar, Todos, Docs, Slack, Linear, WhatsApp, and the list keeps growing. Every person has a different stack, but the problem is the same.

Our days are filled with small repetitive actions. Every calendar event we create is a few minutes gone. Every mail you draft, every todo you try to complete, every email you read that is not useful adds up. Every little task and chore you do in the tools you use every day, just to maintain your digital life and keep everything structured and clean, is a burden.

<Note>
  Most of this is not real work. It is maintenance. Each task feels small in isolation, but together they are mentally tolling.
</Note>

Over time, inboxes get cluttered, todo lists rot, messages pile up, and important things slip through. This slow accumulation is what pushes people into jobs they hate, not because the work itself is meaningless, but because their mental bandwidth is constantly consumed by noise.

### The Solution

Automation should fix this, but it doesn't. Most tools are rigid, technical, and built for power users. Even with LLMs, the burden is still on the user. You have to explain context, explain your style, explain your preferences, again and again.

**Our goal with GAIA is to remove this mental load entirely.** One assistant that understands your entire digital life, remembers everything, and quietly handles the boring, repetitive work for you. Not reactive, but proactive.
