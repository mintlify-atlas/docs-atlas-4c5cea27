## Overview

Workflows in GAIA allow you to automate repetitive tasks and create sophisticated multi-step processes. Use AI to generate workflows from descriptions, or build them manually with triggers and actions.

## Understanding workflows

### What are workflows?

A workflow is an automated sequence of actions triggered by specific events:

- **Trigger**: The event that starts the workflow (e.g., new email, scheduled time, todo completed)
- **Steps**: A series of actions GAIA performs (e.g., create todo, send email, update calendar)
- **Conditions**: Optional logic to control when steps execute

### Workflow components

## Creating workflows

### AI-generated workflows

Let GAIA create workflows for you:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe your automation">
    Tell GAIA what you want to automate:
    - "Create a workflow that emails me a summary of my todos every morning"
    - "Automate meeting preparation: create a todo 1 hour before each calendar event"
    - "Send weekly reports every Friday at 5pm"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the workflow">
    GAIA analyzes your request and generates:
    - Appropriate trigger
    - Sequence of actions
    - Any necessary conditions or filters
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customize if needed">
    Adjust the workflow:
    - Modify trigger settings
    - Add or remove steps
    - Change action parameters
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Activate">
    Enable the workflow to start automation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Be specific in your description. Include trigger timing, actions to perform, and any conditions. The more detail you provide, the better GAIA can generate the workflow.
</Tip>

### Manual workflow creation

Build workflows step-by-step:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open workflow builder">
    Navigate to **Workflows** in the sidebar and click **Create Workflow**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name your workflow">
    Give it a descriptive name like "Morning Email Digest" or "Meeting Prep Automation".
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure trigger">
    Select a trigger type and configure its settings:
    - **Schedule**: Run at specific times
    - **Email**: Trigger on incoming messages
    - **Todo**: When tasks are created or completed
    - **Calendar**: Before or after events
    - **Manual**: Run on demand
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add actions">
    Build your workflow steps:
    - Click **Add Step**
    - Choose an action type
    - Configure action parameters
    - Use variables from previous steps
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test the workflow">
    Run a test execution to verify it works correctly.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Activate">
    Enable the workflow to begin automation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### From todos

Convert complex tasks into workflows:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a todo">
    Click on any todo that involves multiple steps or could benefit from automation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate workflow">
    Click **Generate Workflow** in the todo details panel.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for generation">
    GAIA analyzes the todo and creates a workflow in the background. You'll receive a notification when it's ready.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review and activate">
    Check the generated workflow and activate it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Workflow generation from todos is powered by `apps/web/src/features/todo/api/todoApi.ts:321`.

## Trigger types

### Schedule triggers

Run workflows at specific times:

- **Fixed schedule**: Daily at 9am, Every Monday at 8pm
- **Cron expressions**: Complex timing patterns
- **Intervals**: Every 30 minutes, Every 2 hours

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily schedules">
    Run once per day at a specific time:
    - Morning summaries
    - End of day reviews
    - Daily backups or reports
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Weekly schedules">
    Run on specific days of the week:
    - Monday morning planning
    - Friday afternoon reports

- **Sort options**: By date, name, or execution count

Workflow listing is managed via `apps/web/src/features/workflows/api/workflowApi.ts:35`.

### Activating and deactivating

Control workflow execution:

**Activate:**
- Click the toggle switch on a workflow
- Or click **Activate** in the workflow details
- Active workflows run automatically based on their triggers

**Deactivate:**
- Turn off the toggle to stop execution
- Workflows remain in your list but won't trigger
- Useful for temporary disabling

Activation is handled via `apps/web/src/features/workflows/api/workflowApi.ts:88`.

### Editing workflows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open workflow">
    Click on any workflow to view its details.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Edit">
    Open the workflow editor.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Modify settings">
    Change trigger, actions, conditions, or any other configuration.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save changes">
    Updates are applied immediately. If the workflow is active, changes take effect on the next execution.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deleting workflows

Remove workflows you no longer need:

1. Click on the workflow
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  Deleted workflows cannot be recovered. Make sure you want to permanently remove the automation.
</Warning>

## Workflow execution

### Automatic execution

Active workflows run automatically when their trigger conditions are met:

- Schedule-based workflows run at their configured times
- Event-based workflows trigger when events occur
- Each execution is logged for monitoring

### Manual execution

Run workflows on demand:

- Click **Execute** on the workflow
- Or ask GAIA: "Run my morning digest workflow"
- Useful for testing or one-off executions

Manual execution is available via `apps/web/src/features/workflows/api/workflowApi.ts:132`.

### Execution history

Monitor workflow performance:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open workflow">
    Click on a workflow to view details.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View history">
    Navigate to the **Execution History** tab.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review executions">
    See past runs with:
    - Execution time
    - Status (success, failed, running)
    - Duration
    - Step-by-step logs
    - Error messages if failed
  </Step>
</Steps>

Execution history is retrieved from `apps/web/src/features/workflows/api/workflowApi.ts:159`.

<Tip>
  Use execution history to debug workflows and understand what happened during each run.
</Tip>

### Error handling

When workflows fail:

- Execution stops at the failed step
- Error details are logged in execution history
- You receive a notification (if enabled)
- Fix the issue and re-run or retry the workflow

## Advanced workflow features

### Conditional logic

Add decision points to your workflows:

- **If/then branches**: Execute different steps based on conditions
- **Filters**: Skip executions when conditions aren't met
- **Loops**: Repeat steps for multiple items

### Variables and data passing

Use dynamic data in your workflows:

- **Trigger data**: Information from the event that started the workflow
- **Step outputs**: Results from previous actions
- **User inputs**: Values you provide when configuring
- **System variables**: Current date, user info, etc.

### Workflow templates

Start from pre-built workflows:

- Browse community workflows for inspiration
- Clone existing workflows and customize
