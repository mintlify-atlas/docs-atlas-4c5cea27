  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  GAIA supports multiple Google Calendars. You can switch between personal, work, and shared calendars easily.
</Note>

## Viewing your calendar

### Calendar page

Access your calendar by clicking the **Calendar** icon in the sidebar. The calendar view shows:

- **Grid view**: Day-by-day event display with time slots
- **All-day events**: Events without specific times appear at the top
- **Event colors**: Match your Google Calendar color coding
- **Current time indicator**: A line showing the current time on today's view

### Date navigation

Navigate through your schedule:

- Use the **date strip** at the top to jump to specific dates
- Click **Today** to return to the current day
- Use arrow buttons to move forward or backward
- Scroll through the week view smoothly

### Calendar selector

Toggle which calendars are displayed:

1. Click the **calendar selector** dropdown
2. Check or uncheck calendars to show or hide their events
3. Changes are saved automatically to your preferences

Preferences are managed via `apps/web/src/features/calendar/api/calendarApi.ts:121`.

## Creating events

### With natural language

Talk to GAIA to schedule events:

- "Schedule a team meeting tomorrow at 2pm for one hour"
- "Add lunch with Sarah on Friday at noon"
- "Create a recurring standup every Monday at 9am"
- "Block my calendar for focus time from 2-4pm today"

GAIA will:
- Parse the date, time, and duration
- Create the event on your default calendar
- Confirm the details with you

<Tip>
  GAIA understands context. You can say "Move the team meeting to Thursday" after just creating it, and GAIA will know which event you mean.
</Tip>

### Using the visual interface

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click a time slot">
    On the calendar grid, click the date and time when you want to create an event.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fill in event details">
    A modal will appear where you can enter:
    - **Title**: Event name
    - **Start time**: When it begins
    - **End time**: When it ends
    - **Description**: Additional details (optional)
    - **Calendar**: Which calendar to add it to
    - **All-day**: Toggle for all-day events
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save the event">
    Click **Create** to add the event to your calendar.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Batch event creation

Create multiple events at once:

- Useful for scheduling a series of meetings or recurring events
- Provide a list of events to GAIA in chat
- The API handles bulk creation efficiently at `apps/web/src/features/calendar/api/calendarApi.ts:203`

<Note>
  Batch operations return both successful and failed events, so you can see which events were created and which need attention.
</Note>

## Managing events

### Viewing event details

Click any event on the calendar to see:

- Full event description
- Attendees (if any)
- Location
- Calendar it belongs to
- Edit and delete options

### Editing events

Modify events in two ways:

**Visual editing:**
1. Click the event to open details
2. Click **Edit**
3. Modify any field
4. Click **Save**

**AI-powered editing:**
- "Move the team meeting to 3pm"
- "Change tomorrow's lunch to 1pm instead of noon"
- "Make the standup 30 minutes instead of 15"

GAIA will find the relevant event and update it accordingly.

### Deleting events

Remove events from your calendar:

**Manual deletion:**
- Click the event
- Click **Delete**
- Confirm the deletion

**AI deletion:**
- "Delete the team meeting on Thursday"
- "Cancel my 3pm appointment"
- "Remove all events labeled 'tentative' next week"

<Warning>
  Deleted events are removed from Google Calendar permanently. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

### Bulk operations

Manage multiple events efficiently:

- **Batch updates**: Modify several events at once (e.g., "Move all Monday meetings to Tuesday")
- **Batch deletion**: Remove multiple events (e.g., "Delete all placeholder events next month")
- APIs support batch operations at `apps/web/src/features/calendar/api/calendarApi.ts:223` and `apps/web/src/features/calendar/api/calendarApi.ts:278`

## Calendar automation

### Smart scheduling

GAIA helps you schedule intelligently:

- **Find free time**: "When am I free tomorrow afternoon?"
- **Avoid conflicts**: Automatically detects scheduling conflicts
- **Suggest times**: "Find a 30-minute slot this week for a client call"
- **Buffer time**: Automatically add buffer between back-to-back meetings

### Event templates

Create reusable event templates for common meetings:

1. Schedule an event with all the standard details
2. GAIA learns your patterns (e.g., "team standup" always at 9am, 15 minutes)
3. Next time, just say "Schedule the usual standup" and GAIA fills in the details

### Calendar-based workflows

Trigger workflows based on calendar events:

- Send reminders before meetings
- Prepare meeting agendas automatically
- Create post-meeting follow-up tasks
- Block focus time before deadlines

See the [Workflow Creation guide](/guide/workflow-creation) for more details.

## Advanced features

### All-day events

Create events without specific times:

- Holidays
- Deadlines
- Multi-day events
- Reminders

All-day events appear at the top of the calendar grid, separate from timed events.

### Recurring events

Set up events that repeat:

- Daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly
- Custom patterns (e.g., "Every other Tuesday")
- End date or number of occurrences
- Edit single instances or the entire series

<Note>
  GAIA understands recurring patterns in natural language. Say "Schedule a weekly review every Friday at 3pm" and it will create the recurring series.
</Note>

### Time zones

GAIA handles time zones automatically:

- Events are displayed in your local time zone
- The timezone is detected from your browser settings
- Specify different time zones in natural language: "Schedule a call at 2pm EST"
- Timezone information is sent with every request via `apps/web/src/features/calendar/api/calendarApi.ts:252`

### Multi-calendar management

Work with multiple calendars seamlessly:

- View events from all calendars in one place
- Create events on specific calendars: "Add to my work calendar"
- Filter by calendar to focus on specific contexts
- Color-coded events match your Google Calendar settings

## Integration with other features

### Todo integration

Todos with due dates appear on your calendar:

- See tasks alongside events
- Plan your day with both meetings and work time
- Complete todos directly from the calendar view

### Chat integration

Manage your calendar conversationally:

- Ask about your schedule: "What's on my calendar today?"
- Get meeting prep: "What meetings do I have tomorrow?"
- Reschedule on the fly: "I need to move my 2pm to 3pm"
- Find free time: "When am I available next week?"

### Email integration

Calendar and email work together:

- Create calendar events from email meeting requests
- Get email reminders before events
- Share calendar availability via email

## Calendar preferences

Customize how GAIA manages your calendar:

- **Default calendar**: Choose which calendar receives new events
- **Event duration**: Set default meeting lengths
- **Work hours**: Define your working hours for smart scheduling
- **Selected calendars**: Choose which calendars are displayed

Update preferences via **Settings** > **Calendar** or by asking GAIA.
