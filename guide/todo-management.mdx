## Overview

GAIA's todo management system helps you organize tasks, track progress, and stay productive. You can create todos manually or let GAIA create them for you through natural language commands.

## Creating todos

### Manual creation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Todos">
    Click the **Todos** icon in the sidebar to open the todo management page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Add Todo">
    Find the **+** button or "Add Todo" button, typically at the top of the list.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fill in details">
    Enter the todo information:
    - **Title**: A clear, concise description of the task
    - **Description**: Additional details or notes (optional)
    - **Due date**: When the task should be completed
    - **Priority**: High, medium, or low
    - **Project**: Assign to a project for better organization
    - **Labels**: Add tags for categorization
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save">
    Click **Save** or press **Enter** to create the todo.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Create with AI

You can create todos by chatting with GAIA:

- "Add a task to review the quarterly report by Friday"
- "Create a todo for team meeting preparation"
- "Remind me to call the client tomorrow afternoon"

GAIA will automatically extract the task details and create the todo with appropriate due dates and priorities.

<Tip>
  GAIA can understand relative dates like "tomorrow," "next week," "in 3 days," and will set the correct due dates automatically.
</Tip>

## Organizing todos

### Projects

Group related todos into projects for better organization:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a project">
    Click the **Projects** section and select **Add Project**. Give it a meaningful name like "Q1 Marketing" or "Website Redesign."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign todos">
    When creating or editing a todo, select the project from the dropdown menu.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View by project">
    Filter your todo list by project to focus on specific work streams.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Projects can be updated, renamed, or deleted from the project management interface.

### Labels

Use labels to categorize todos across projects:

- Add multiple labels to a single todo
- Filter todos by label to find related tasks
- Popular labels include: `urgent`, `follow-up`, `waiting`, `review`

<Note>
  The system tracks label usage and shows you the most frequently used labels for quick access from `apps/web/src/features/todo/api/todoApi.ts:204`.
</Note>

### Priority levels

Set priorities to focus on what matters most:

- **High**: Urgent tasks that need immediate attention (shown in red)
- **Medium**: Important but not urgent (shown in yellow)
- **Low**: Tasks that can wait (shown in blue)

## Todo views

### Inbox

The default view for new, unorganized todos. Tasks appear here until you assign them to a project or schedule them.

### Today

Shows all todos due today. This view helps you focus on what needs to be done right now.

### Upcoming

Displays tasks scheduled for the future, organized by due date. Use this to plan ahead and prepare for upcoming work.

### Completed

View your finished tasks. This is great for:
- Reviewing what you've accomplished
- Finding information from past tasks
- Tracking productivity over time

### Overdue

Highlights tasks that are past their due date. These appear in red to draw attention.

<Warning>
  Overdue tasks require immediate attention. Review this list regularly to stay on track.
</Warning>

## Working with todos

### Completing tasks

Mark todos as complete in several ways:

- Click the checkbox next to the todo title
- Open the todo details and click **Mark Complete**
- Tell GAIA: "Mark the quarterly report task as done"

Completed todos are moved to the Completed view automatically.

### Editing todos

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select the todo">
    Click on any todo to open the details panel on the right side.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Modify details">
    Update any field including title, description, due date, priority, project, or labels.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save changes">
    Changes are saved automatically as you edit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Bulk operations

Manage multiple todos at once:

1. Select multiple todos using checkboxes
2. Choose a bulk action:
   - **Complete**: Mark all selected as done
   - **Move**: Assign to a different project
   - **Delete**: Remove selected todos

Bulk operations are powered by the API endpoints at `apps/web/src/features/todo/api/todoApi.ts:122`.

### Search and filter

Find specific todos quickly:

- **Text search**: Type in the search box to find todos by title or description
- **Semantic search**: Use natural language to find related todos (e.g., "tasks about the client presentation")
- **Filters**: Combine project, label, priority, and completion status

<Tip>
  Semantic search uses AI to understand the meaning of your query, not just keyword matching. It's powered by vector embeddings from `apps/web/src/features/todo/api/todoApi.ts:280`.
</Tip>

## Todo workflows

### Generate workflow from todo

GAIA can create automated workflows for complex tasks:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open todo details">
    Click on a todo to view its details in the right panel.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Generate Workflow">
    Find the **Generate Workflow** button in the todo details.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review workflow">
    GAIA analyzes the todo and creates a multi-step workflow with appropriate actions and automation.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Activate or customize">
    You can activate the workflow immediately or customize the steps before activation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Workflows are generated in the background and you'll receive a notification when ready.

<Note>
  Workflow generation uses AI to break down complex tasks into manageable steps. The status is tracked via `apps/web/src/features/todo/api/todoApi.ts:345`.
</Note>

## Advanced features

### Smart due dates

GAIA understands various date formats:

- Natural language: "tomorrow", "next Monday", "in 2 weeks"
- Relative dates: "in 3 days", "2 weeks from now"
- Specific dates: "March 15", "3/15/2026"
- Time-aware: "tomorrow at 2pm", "next Friday afternoon"

### Recurring todos

Set up tasks that repeat automatically:

- Daily, weekly, monthly, or custom intervals
- Automatically creates a new instance when marked complete
- Great for regular check-ins, reviews, or maintenance tasks

### Todo counts and statistics

Track your productivity with built-in statistics:

- View counts by category (inbox, today, upcoming, completed, overdue)
- See completion trends over time
- Identify bottlenecks and overdue patterns

These counts are optimized for performance and retrieved from `apps/web/src/features/todo/api/todoApi.ts:192`.

## Integration with other features

### Calendar integration

Todos with due dates automatically appear on your calendar, helping you visualize your workload alongside meetings and events.

### Email integration

Create todos from emails:
- GAIA can suggest todos based on email content
- Convert action items from emails into tracked tasks
- Link todos back to original emails for context

### Chat integration

Manage todos conversationally:
- "What's on my todo list for today?"
- "Move the client presentation task to next week"
- "Show me all high-priority tasks"
