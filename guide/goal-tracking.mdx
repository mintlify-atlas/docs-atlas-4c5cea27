## Overview

GAIA's goal tracking system helps you define long-term objectives, break them down into actionable steps, and track progress over time. The system uses AI to generate roadmaps and visualize your path to success.

## Understanding goals

### What are goals?

Goals in GAIA are high-level objectives you want to achieve:

- **Personal goals**: Learn a new skill, improve health, develop habits
- **Professional goals**: Career advancement, project completion, skill development
- **Business goals**: Revenue targets, customer acquisition, product launches
- **Learning goals**: Complete courses, master technologies, gain certifications

### Goals vs. Todos

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Goals" icon="bullseye">
    Long-term objectives that take weeks, months, or years to achieve. They have roadmaps with multiple milestones.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Todos" icon="list-check">
    Short-term tasks completed in days or hours. They're actionable items with clear completion criteria.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Goals can contain todos as action items, but they're broader in scope and timeline.

## Creating goals

### Manual goal creation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Goals">
    Click the **Goals** icon in the sidebar to open the goals page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Add Goal">
    Find the **Add Goal** or **+** button to open the goal creation dialog.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define your goal">
    Fill in the goal details:
    - **Title**: A clear, specific goal statement (e.g., "Launch MVP of mobile app")
    - **Description**: Detailed explanation of what you want to achieve and why
    - **Target date**: When you want to achieve this goal (optional)
    - **Category**: Personal, professional, health, learning, etc.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save the goal">
    Click **Create** to save your goal.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### AI-assisted goal creation

Let GAIA help you define your goal:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe your objective">
    Tell GAIA what you want to achieve: "I want to get fit and run a 5K race" or "I want to learn Python for data science."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Provide context">
    Share additional information:
    - Your current situation
    - Timeline or deadline
    - Resources available
    - Constraints or challenges
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the goal">
    GAIA will help you formulate a clear, achievable goal with:
    - Specific outcome
    - Measurable criteria
    - Realistic timeline
    - Action-oriented language
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate roadmap">
    GAIA can automatically create a roadmap with milestones and action items.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Use the SMART framework: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound. GAIA can help you refine vague goals into SMART goals.
</Tip>

## Goal roadmaps

### What is a roadmap?

A roadmap is a visual representation of the steps needed to achieve your goal:

- **Nodes**: Milestones or action items
- **Connections**: Dependencies between steps
- **Progress**: Visual tracking of completed vs. pending items
- **Timeline**: Estimated duration for each phase

### AI-generated roadmaps

GAIA creates roadmaps automatically:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your goal">
    Click on any goal to view its details.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate roadmap">
    If the goal doesn't have a roadmap yet, click **Generate Roadmap**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for AI processing">
    GAIA analyzes your goal and creates a structured plan with:
    - Key milestones
    - Sub-goals or phases
    - Action items
    - Suggested timeline
    - Dependencies between steps
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review and customize">
    The roadmap appears as a visual graph. You can:
    - Add or remove nodes
    - Adjust connections
    - Modify descriptions
    - Update timelines
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Roadmap generation uses AI to break down complex goals into manageable steps. The algorithm considers best practices and common patterns for achieving similar goals.
</Note>

### Roadmap visualization

The roadmap is displayed as an interactive graph:

- **Nodes**: Circular elements representing each step
- **Lines**: Connections showing workflow and dependencies
- **Colors**: Visual indicators of status:
  - Gray: Not started
  - Blue: In progress
  - Green: Completed
- **Layout**: Automatic positioning for easy understanding

The visualization uses React Flow for interactive node manipulation from `apps/web/src/features/goals/components/CustomNode.tsx`.

### Editing roadmaps

Customize your roadmap:

- **Add nodes**: Click **Add Step** to create new milestones
- **Remove nodes**: Delete steps that aren't needed
- **Edit details**: Click any node to update its title and description
- **Reorder steps**: Drag and drop nodes to reorganize
- **Update connections**: Modify dependencies between steps

## Tracking progress

### Marking steps complete

Update progress as you work:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the goal">
    Navigate to the goal you're working on.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="View the roadmap">
    The roadmap shows all steps and their current status.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete a step">
    Click the checkbox on any node to mark it complete. The node turns green.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Track overall progress">
    The goal shows overall completion percentage based on completed nodes.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Node status updates are saved via `apps/web/src/features/goals/api/goalsApi.ts:36`.

### Progress visualization

See your progress at a glance:

- **Completion percentage**: Overall progress bar
- **Completed nodes**: Count of finished steps
- **Visual roadmap**: Green nodes show completed work
- **Timeline tracking**: Compare actual vs. estimated timeline

### Goal status

Goals have different states:

- **Active**: Currently working on this goal
- **On hold**: Temporarily paused
- **Completed**: Goal achieved
- **Abandoned**: No longer pursuing

<Tip>
  Update goal status regularly to reflect your current priorities. This helps you focus on active goals.
</Tip>

## Managing goals

### Goal list view

The goals page shows all your goals:

- **Filter by status**: Active, completed, or all
- **Filter by category**: Personal, professional, etc.
- **Sort options**: By date created, target date, or progress
- **Search**: Find goals by title or description

### Goal details

Click any goal to see:

- Full description
- Target date and timeline
- Current progress and completion rate
- Interactive roadmap
- Related todos and workflows
- Notes and updates

### Editing goals

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the goal">
    Click on any goal in your list.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Edit">
    Open the goal editor.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Modify details">
    Update title, description, target date, or category.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save changes">
    Changes are applied immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Goal updates are handled via `apps/web/src/features/goals/api/goalsApi.ts:28`.

### Deleting goals

Remove goals you no longer want to track:

1. Open the goal
2. Click **Delete**
3. Confirm the deletion

<Warning>
  Deleting a goal removes its roadmap and all progress tracking. This action cannot be undone.
</Warning>

## Goal strategies

### Breaking down large goals

For ambitious goals, use a hierarchical approach:

1. **Main goal**: The ultimate objective
2. **Sub-goals**: Major phases or milestones
3. **Action items**: Specific tasks within each phase
4. **Todos**: Day-to-day work items

### Setting realistic timelines

Estimate timelines effectively:

- **Start date**: When you'll begin working on this goal
- **Target date**: Realistic completion date
- **Milestones**: Intermediate deadlines for key phases
- **Buffer time**: Add extra time for unexpected delays

### Review and adjust

Regularly review your goals:

- **Weekly reviews**: Check progress on active goals
- **Monthly assessments**: Evaluate if goals are still relevant
- **Adjust roadmaps**: Update steps based on learnings
- **Celebrate wins**: Acknowledge completed milestones

## Advanced features
