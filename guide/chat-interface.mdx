## Advanced features

### Replying to specific messages

Create context-aware responses:

- Click the **Reply** button
- Your response will reference the specific message, helping GAIA understand the context

### Context from calendar and todos

You can attach context to your messages:

- **Reference a todo**: Link your message to a specific task for better context
- **Use workflows**: Execute pre-defined workflows directly from chat

### Streaming responses

GAIA responds in real-time using streaming technology. You'll see the response appear word-by-word as it's generated, allowing you to:

- Start reading before the full response is complete
- Stop generation if you've got the answer you need
- See GAIA's thought process as it works

<Note>
  The chat uses server-sent events (SSE) to stream responses efficiently from `apps/web/src/features/chat/api/chatApi.ts:244`.
</Note>

## System-generated conversations

Some conversations are created automatically by GAIA:

- **Email processing**: When GAIA processes your emails
- **Workflow execution**: Results from automated workflows
- **Scheduled tasks**: Updates from timed operations

These appear with a special indicator and help you track GAIA's autonomous actions.
