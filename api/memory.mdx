# Memory API

The Memory API enables storage and retrieval of contextual information to personalize AI interactions and maintain context across conversations.

## Memory Object

<ResponseField name="id" type="string">
  Unique memory identifier
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="content" type="string">
  Memory content/text
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="metadata" type="object">
  Optional metadata (tags, categories, source, etc.)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="created_at" type="string">
  ISO 8601 creation timestamp
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="updated_at" type="string">
  ISO 8601 last update timestamp
</ResponseField>

## Endpoints

### Get All Memories

Retrieve all memories for the current user.

```bash
GET /api/v1/memory
```

```json Response
{
  "memories": [
    {
      "id": "mem_123",
      "content": "User prefers concise communication style",
      "metadata": {
        "category": "communication_preference",
        "source": "conversation"
      },
      "created_at": "2026-02-15T10:00:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-02-15T10:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "mem_456",
      "content": "Working on machine learning project using PyTorch",
      "metadata": {
        "category": "current_projects",
        "tags": ["ml", "pytorch"]
      },
      "created_at": "2026-02-18T14:30:00Z",
      "updated_at": "2026-02-18T14:30:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "total": 2
}
```

### Create Memory

Store a new memory.

```bash
POST /api/v1/memory
```

```json Request
{
  "content": "User is learning Spanish and practices daily at 7 AM",
  "metadata": {
    "category": "habits",
    "tags": ["language", "routine"],
    "source": "user_input"
  }
}
```

```json Response
{
  "success": true,
  "memory_id": "mem_789",
  "message": "Memory created successfully"
}
```

<ParamField body="content" type="string" required>
  Memory content to store
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="metadata" type="object">
  Optional metadata for categorization and filtering
  
  Common fields:
  - `category` - Memory category (preferences, habits, projects, etc.)
  - `tags` - Array of tags for easy filtering
  - `source` - Where the memory came from (conversation, user_input, etc.)
  - `importance` - Importance level (high, medium, low)
</ParamField>

### Delete Memory

Delete a specific memory.

```bash
DELETE /api/v1/memory/{memory_id}
```

```json Response
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Memory deleted successfully"
}
```

### Clear All Memories

Delete all memories for the current user.

```bash
DELETE /api/v1/memory
```

<Warning>
  This operation is irreversible. All memories will be permanently deleted.
</Warning>

```json Response
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "All memories cleared successfully"
}
```

## How Memories Work

### Automatic Memory Creation

GAIA can automatically create memories during conversations when it learns new information about you:

- User preferences (communication style, working hours, etc.)
- Current projects and goals
- Important contacts and relationships
- Habits and routines
- Technical preferences (programming languages, tools, etc.)

### Memory Retrieval

Memories are automatically retrieved and used to:

- Personalize AI responses
- Provide relevant context in conversations
- Suggest proactive actions
- Improve recommendation quality

### Semantic Search

Memories are stored with embeddings for semantic search, allowing GAIA to find relevant memories even when exact keywords don't match.

Example:
- Query: "What programming language am I using?"
- Matched Memory: "Working on machine learning project using PyTorch"

## Use Cases

### Personal Preferences

```json
{
  "content": "Prefers morning meetings between 9-11 AM",
  "metadata": {
    "category": "scheduling_preferences"
  }
}
```

### Project Context

```json
{
  "content": "Building e-commerce platform with Next.js and Stripe",
  "metadata": {
    "category": "current_projects",
    "tags": ["nextjs", "stripe", "ecommerce"]
  }
}
```

### Communication Style

```json
{
  "content": "Appreciates direct, concise responses without excessive pleasantries",
  "metadata": {
    "category": "communication_preference"
  }
}
```

### Important Dates

```json
{
  "content": "Product launch scheduled for March 15, 2026",
  "metadata": {
    "category": "important_dates",
    "tags": ["deadline", "product_launch"]
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

Memory operations are subject to rate limits:

- **Free:** 50 operations/hour
- **Pro:** 500 operations/hour
- **Team:** 2000 operations/hour

See [Rate Limits](/api/rate-limits) for details.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Store meaningful context">
    Focus on storing information that helps personalize future interactions:
    
    ✅ Good: "Prefers TypeScript over JavaScript for new projects"
    
    ❌ Poor: "User clicked a button"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use metadata for organization">
    Add categories and tags to make memories searchable:
    
    ```json
    {
      "content": "Uses VS Code with Vim keybindings",
      "metadata": {
        "category": "development_tools",
        "tags": ["vscode", "vim", "editor"]
      }
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Update stale memories">
    Delete or update memories when information becomes outdated:
    
    ```bash
    # Delete old memory
    DELETE /api/v1/memory/mem_old_project
    
    # Create updated memory
    POST /api/v1/memory
    {
      "content": "Now working with React Native instead of Flutter"
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be specific and actionable">
    Store specific, actionable information rather than vague statements:
    
    ✅ "Holds 1:1 meetings with direct reports every other Friday at 2 PM"
    
    ❌ "Likes meetings"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Privacy & Security

- Memories are encrypted at rest and in transit
- Only the authenticated user can access their memories
- Memories are not shared with other users
- Deleting your account permanently deletes all memories
