## Welcome Contributors

Welcome to GAIA development! We're building a proactive personal AI assistant that goes beyond traditional assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and ChatGPT. GAIA is designed to understand your entire digital life, remember everything, and quietly handle repetitive work for you - not just react to commands, but act proactively.

We welcome contributions of all kinds, from bug fixes and new features to documentation and testing. AI and vibe-coded PRs are welcome - just mention it in your PR description!

## What is GAIA?

GAIA is your proactive, personal AI assistant designed to increase your productivity by:

- **Acting proactively** on upcoming deadlines, important emails, and tasks
- **Automating workflows** to eliminate repetitive tasks from email triage to document creation
- **Managing todos** as mini-workflows where GAIA researches, drafts, and handles work automatically
- **Unifying productivity** with all your tasks, emails, calendar, and goals in one dashboard
- **Building memory** through a graph-based knowledge system that connects everything
- **Integrating everywhere** with hundreds of integrations to connect your favorite tools

## Architecture Overview

GAIA is built as a full-stack monorepo using Nx. The system is organized into three main layers:

### Frontend Applications

- **Web App** (Next.js 16 + React 19) - Web-based interface with App Router and Server Components
- **Desktop App** (Electron) - Native desktop application for macOS, Windows, and Linux
- **Mobile App** (React Native + Expo) - Native mobile app for iOS and Android

### Backend Services

- **API** (FastAPI + LangGraph) - Python backend with AI agent orchestration
- **Voice Agent** - Dedicated voice processing worker
- **Bots** - Discord, Slack, and Telegram integrations

### Infrastructure

- **PostgreSQL** - Primary relational database
- **MongoDB** - Document storage for flexible data
- **Redis** - Caching and task queue (ARQ)
- **ChromaDB** - Vector database for embeddings
- **RabbitMQ** - Message broker for async communication

### Development Tools

- **Nx** - Monorepo management with smart caching and task orchestration
- **pnpm** - Fast, disk space efficient package manager
- **uv** - Ultra-fast Python package installer and resolver
- **Docker** - Containerization for consistent development and deployment
- **Biome** (Frontend) - All-in-one toolchain for linting and formatting
- **Ruff** (Backend) - Extremely fast Python linter and formatter

## Key Features for Developers

### Monorepo Structure

The project uses Nx to manage a monorepo containing all applications and shared libraries. This provides:

- **Shared code** between applications through the `libs/shared` directory
- **Incremental builds** with intelligent caching
- **Parallel execution** of tasks across multiple projects
- **Dependency graph** visualization to understand project relationships

### Feature-Based Organization

Code is organized by features, not by technical layers:

```
src/features/
  chat/         - Chat interface and messaging
  todo/         - Task management
  calendar/     - Calendar and scheduling
  workflows/    - Workflow automation
  integrations/ - Third-party integrations
```

This makes it easy to find related code and maintain features independently.

### Type Safety

- **TypeScript** with strict mode enabled for frontend code
- **Python type hints** enforced with mypy for backend code
- **Pydantic** for runtime validation and serialization

### Code Quality

- **Biome** for consistent JavaScript/TypeScript formatting and linting
- **Ruff** for fast Python linting and formatting
- **No inline imports** - all imports must be at top of file
- **No `any` types** in TypeScript - proper type definitions required
- **Strict type hints** in Python for all function parameters and returns
