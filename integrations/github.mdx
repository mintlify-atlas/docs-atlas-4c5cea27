## Metadata Extraction

GAIA automatically extracts your GitHub username:

```json
{
  "username": "your-github-username"
}
```

This enables:
- Repository filtering
- User attribution  
- Personalized workflows

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Repository access denied">
    Check that you granted GAIA access to the specific repository during OAuth. Update permissions in GitHub Settings > Applications.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't merge pull request">
    Verify you have merge permissions and all required checks have passed. Some repositories require admin approval.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Actions workflow not triggering">
    Ensure the workflow file is properly configured and the event trigger matches your setup.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rate limit errors">
    GitHub has API rate limits (5,000 requests/hour for authenticated users). GAIA handles rate limiting automatically.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Use descriptive issue titles and PR descriptions to help GAIA understand context better.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Link related issues and PRs using GitHub's syntax: "Closes #42" or "Related to #38".
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Be careful with force push operations. GAIA will warn you before executing destructive actions.
</Warning>

## Advanced Usage

### Automated Code Review

```
You: Set up automatic code review for all PRs in myrepo

GAIA: I'll create an automated code review workflow:

✓ Workflow created: PR Auto-Review
  Trigger: New pull request
  Actions:
    - Review code changes
    - Check for common issues
    - Post review comments
    - Approve if all checks pass
```

### Issue Triage

```
You: Label all new issues mentioning "bug" as "bug" and assign to @john

GAIA: Setting up issue triage automation...

✓ Triage rule created
  Trigger: New issue with "bug"
  Actions:
    - Add label: "bug"
    - Assign to: @john
    - Set priority: High
```

### Release Automation

```
You: Create a new release v1.2.0 with the changelog from recent commits

GAIA: Creating release v1.2.0...
