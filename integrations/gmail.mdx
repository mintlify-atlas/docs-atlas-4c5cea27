## Metadata Extraction

GAIA automatically extracts and stores your Gmail email address when you connect:

```json
{
  "email": "your.email@gmail.com"
}
```

This is used for:
- Personalizing email composition
- Filtering your own sent emails
- Identifying your email address in conversations

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OAuth authorization failed">
    Make sure you're signing in with the correct Google account and accepting all permission requests.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't read emails">
    Verify that you granted the `gmail.modify` scope during authorization. You may need to reconnect the integration.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rate limit errors">
    Gmail has API rate limits. GAIA automatically handles rate limiting, but extremely high volume may cause delays.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Is my email data secure?">
    Yes. GAIA uses OAuth for secure authentication and never stores your Gmail password. Your credentials are encrypted and only used to make API calls on your behalf.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can GAIA send emails on my behalf?">
    Yes, but only when you explicitly ask it to. The AI agent will always confirm before sending important emails.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does GAIA read all my emails?">
    GAIA only accesses emails when you specifically ask it to. It doesn't continuously monitor your inbox unless you set up a workflow trigger.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Use specific search criteria to help GAIA find emails faster. Instead of "show me emails", try "show me unread emails from John about the project".
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Create labels for automated organization. For example: "Label all emails from newsletter@* as Newsletters".
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Be careful with bulk actions like "delete all emails from X". GAIA will usually ask for confirmation, but it's good to double-check.
</Warning>
