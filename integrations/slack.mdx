  "user_id": "U123ABC",
  "username": "john.smith",
  "team_id": "T456DEF",
  "team_name": "Acme Corp"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't send messages to channel">
    Verify GAIA is added to the channel. Use `/invite @GAIA` in the channel.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="File upload failed">
    Check file size limits (Slack free: 5GB per file). Ensure file format is supported.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="User not found">
    Make sure you're using the correct username or user ID. Users must be in the same workspace.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Permission errors">
    Some actions require specific OAuth scopes. You may need to reconnect the integration.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Use @mentions to notify specific users: "Send to #engineering: @john please review the PR"
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Format messages with markdown: Use *bold*, _italic_, `code`, and > quotes for better readability.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Be mindful of channel activity. Avoid spamming channels with automated messages.
