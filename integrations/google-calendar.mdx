## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Events not showing up">
    Check that you've selected the correct calendar. GAIA defaults to your primary calendar but you can specify others.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't create events">
    Verify that you granted the `calendar.events` scope during OAuth. You may need to reconnect and accept all permissions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Time zone issues">
    GAIA uses your account's default time zone. Make sure your Google Calendar settings have the correct time zone.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Recurring events not working">
    Ensure you're using the `CUSTOM_ADD_RECURRENCE` tool. Complex recurrence patterns may need to be broken down into simpler rules.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Be specific with time and duration: "Schedule a 30-minute meeting tomorrow at 2pm" works better than "schedule a meeting tomorrow".
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Use natural language for dates: "next Friday", "in two weeks", "tomorrow at 2pm" all work perfectly.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  When working with attendees, make sure to use full email addresses to avoid ambiguity.
</Warning>

## Smart Scheduling Tips

### Finding Optimal Meeting Times

```
You: Find a time for a 1-hour meeting with john@example.com this week

GAIA: Checking availability for you and john@example.com...

Best options:
1. Thursday 2:00 PM - 3:00 PM ✓ Both available
2. Friday 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM ✓ Both available
```

### Buffer Time

```
You: Schedule meetings with at least 15 minutes buffer between them

GAIA: I'll make sure to leave 15-minute gaps between your meetings going forward.
```
