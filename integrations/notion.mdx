The Notion integration allows GAIA to create, read, and update pages and databases in your Notion workspace. Build and manage your knowledge base with natural language.

## Features

- **Page Management**: Create, update, and organize Notion pages
- **Database Operations**: Manage databases and their entries
- **Content Search**: Find pages and content across your workspace
- **Property Updates**: Update page properties and metadata
- **Block Manipulation**: Work with different block types
- **Workspace Organization**: Structure your Notion workspace

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Integrations">
    Navigate to **Settings > Integrations** in GAIA
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Notion">
    Search for "Notion" in the Productivity category
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect Workspace">
    Click **Connect** to start OAuth flow
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Pages">
    In Notion's authorization screen, select which pages GAIA can access
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Authorization">
    Click "Allow" to grant GAIA access to your Notion workspace
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  You need to explicitly grant GAIA access to specific Notion pages during setup. You can always modify permissions later in Notion settings.
</Warning>

## OAuth Configuration

The Notion integration uses OAuth 2.0:

- **Provider**: Composio
- **Toolkit**: NOTION
- **Auth Type**: OAuth 2.0
- **Workspace Scopes**: Selected by user during authorization

### Provider Details

- **Featured**: Yes
- **Managed By**: Composio platform

## Usage Examples

### Creating Pages

```
You: Create a new page called "Project Ideas" in my Notion workspace

GAIA: I'll create that page for you.

✓ Created page: "Project Ideas"
  Location: Root workspace
  Page ID: abc123...
```

### Adding to Databases

```
You: Add a new task to my "Tasks" database: "Review Q4 metrics" with status "To Do"

GAIA: Added new entry to Tasks database:

✓ Task: Review Q4 metrics
  Status: To Do
  Created: Just now
```

### Searching Content

```
You: Find all pages about "marketing strategy"

GAIA: I found 4 pages matching "marketing strategy":

1. Marketing Strategy 2024 (Updated 2 days ago)

You: Update the status of "Write blog post" to "In Progress"

GAIA: Updated task properties:

✓ Write blog post
  Status: To Do → In Progress
  Updated: Just now
```

### Organizing Content

```
You: Move all pages tagged "archive" to the Archive folder

GAIA: Moving 7 pages to Archive folder...

## Workflows & Triggers

Notion supports several automation triggers:

### Page Added to Database Trigger

**Trigger**: When a new page is added to a specific database

**Configuration**:

**Configuration**:
```yaml
trigger: notion_all_page_events
config: {}
```

**Use Cases**:
- Workspace activity monitoring
- Comprehensive backup
- Cross-workspace synchronization

## AI Agent Details

## API Reference

Key tools available:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `NOTION_GET_ABOUT_ME` | Get workspace and user info |
| `NOTION_SEARCH` | Search pages and databases |
| `NOTION_CREATE_PAGE` | Create a new page |
| `NOTION_UPDATE_PAGE` | Update page properties |
| `NOTION_GET_PAGE` | Retrieve page details |

For complete API documentation, see [Notion Tools Reference](/api-reference/integrations/notion).

## Metadata Extraction

GAIA automatically extracts your Notion workspace info:

```json
{
  "user_id": "user_abc123",
  "workspace_id": "ws_xyz789",
  "workspace_name": "My Workspace"
}
```

This is used for:
- Workspace-specific operations
- User attribution
- Permission management

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't access certain pages">
    GAIA can only access pages you explicitly granted during OAuth. Go to Notion Settings > Integrations to modify permissions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Database operations failing">
    Ensure the database has the required properties. GAIA will tell you which properties are missing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Search not finding pages">
    Notion's search only includes pages GAIA has access to. Check your integration permissions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Page creation errors">
    Verify you have edit permissions in the target location. Some workspaces restrict page creation.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Grant GAIA access to your top-level folders so it can create pages anywhere in your workspace.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Use database templates to ensure consistent properties when creating new entries.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  Be specific about which database when you have multiple databases with similar names.
</Warning>

## Advanced Usage

### Working with Databases

```
You: Create a new CRM database with properties: Name (title), Email (email), Status (select), and Last Contact (date)

GAIA: Creating CRM database with specified properties...

✓ Created database: "CRM"
  Properties: Name, Email, Status, Last Contact
  Location: Root workspace
```

### Complex Queries

```
You: Show me all tasks in the "Projects" database that are marked "High Priority" and due this week

GAIA: Found 3 high-priority tasks due this week:

1. Launch marketing campaign (Due: Wednesday)
2. Finalize Q4 budget (Due: Thursday)  
3. Review contract proposal (Due: Friday)
```

### Batch Operations

```
You: Update all tasks assigned to "John" to status "In Review"

GAIA: Updating tasks assigned to John...

✓ Updated 5 tasks to "In Review" status
```
