## Metadata Extraction

GAIA automatically extracts your Linear user info:

```json
{
  "user_id": "user_abc123",
  "username": "John Smith",
  "email": "john@company.com"
}
```

This enables:
- Auto-assignment of issues
- Filtering by current user
- Team mentions and notifications

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't create issues">
    Verify you have write permissions in your Linear workspace. Check with your workspace admin.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Team not found">
    Make sure you're referencing the correct team name or ID. Use `List Teams` to see available teams.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Status update failed">
    The status must be valid for your team's workflow. Each team can have custom status values.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Assignment errors">
    You can only assign issues to team members. Verify the user is part of the target team.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
  Use clear, descriptive issue titles. Good: "Login API returns 500 on invalid password". Bad: "Fix login".
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Include acceptance criteria in issue descriptions to help GAIA understand completion requirements.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  When bulk updating issues, always specify team ID or project to avoid ambiguity.
</Warning>

## Advanced Usage
