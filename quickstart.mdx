## Self-Hosting

Deploy GAIA on your own infrastructure for complete control and data privacy.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prerequisites">
    Ensure you have these installed:
    - Docker and Docker Compose
    - Git
    - 4GB+ RAM available
    - PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis (or use Docker Compose)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/theexperiencecompany/gaia.git
    cd gaia
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
    Copy the example environment files and configure them:
    
    ```bash
    # API configuration
    cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
    
    # Web app configuration  
    cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      You'll need to configure:
      - Database connection strings
      - API keys for LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
      - OAuth credentials for integrations
    </Warning>
    
    See the [Self-Hosting Guide](https://docs.heygaia.io/self-hosting/overview) for detailed configuration.

    - Next.js web app (port 3000)
    - PostgreSQL database
    - MongoDB
    - Redis
    - ChromaDB for vector storage
    - RabbitMQ message broker

      Use profiles to start specific components:
      ```bash
      # Backend only
      docker compose --profile backend up
      
      # Worker only
      docker compose --profile worker up
      ```
